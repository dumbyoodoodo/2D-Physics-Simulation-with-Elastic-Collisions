This project is a 2D physics simulation built with C++ and SFML that models dynamic interactions between multiple bouncing balls. Each ball moves with an initial velocity and responds to collisions with both the window boundaries and other balls. The simulation features:

-Wall collisions: Balls bounce off the edges of the window with perfectly elastic behavior, reversing direction upon impact.

-Ball-to-ball collisions: Inter-ball collisions are detected using distance checks and resolved using impulse-based physics to simulate elastic collisions.

-Gravity (optional extension): Gravity can be added to simulate downward acceleration, creating more realistic motion over time.

-Dynamic ball management: Balls can be added or removed during runtime, allowing for an interactive and adjustable simulation environment.

The project demonstrates foundational principles of 2D physics, collision detection, and real-time graphics using the SFML library.
